# Data Cleaning:
 The json file provided had a lot of null values and so I have cleaned the data first. The data cleaning code is the file: Data Cleaning.ipynb
# Dataset after cleaning: 
The file was converted to csv for updating it in MySQL to create a database. This data file after cleaning is: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DmYVICLZWl7D4HEFIx1eaLKkcU8Afkyj/view?usp=sharing
# Loading the cleaned data into a database using MySQL: 
 The code for loading the data in the database is given in: Loading the dataset.sql 
# Connecting with MySQL using python to get the data and using it for data visualization:
The python code is Developing the dashboard.py  and html file is dashboard.html
Developing the dashboard.py: https://drive.google.com/file/d/13M8suMFTebiFopT97qIdIuJP_W8cj1_h/view?usp=sharing
Dashboard.html is the file that helps in displaying the dashboard as per the features we wish to add.
On running the python file Developing the dashboard.py, the console will display the url of the dashboard I have created with this code.
